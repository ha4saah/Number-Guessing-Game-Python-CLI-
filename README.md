## 🚀 How It Works

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- The player selects a difficulty level:
  - 🟢 **Easy** – 10 attempts
  - 🟡 **Medium** – 5 attempts
  - 🔴 **Hard** – 3 attempts
- The player enters guesses, and the program gives feedback:
  - Whether the guess is **too high** or **too low**.
  - Ends the game if the correct number is guessed or attempts run out.
